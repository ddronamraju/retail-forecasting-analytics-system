# End-to-End Retail Forecasting & Decision Intelligence System

## 1. Business Context

This system is designed around large-format retail (e.g., Walmart), where thousands of
store–department combinations must be forecasted for demand, inventory, and promotions.

## 2. System Overview

The solution is decomposed into modular components:

- Baseline forecasting
- Monitoring and anomaly detection
- Pricing and promotion analytics
- SKU segmentation
- Inventory risk modeling
- Feature engineering and model training
- Decision tools and dashboards

## 3. Baseline Prophet Forecast (Store–Department Level)

This module builds an interpretable baseline forecast for a chosen store–department
time series using Prophet. It provides:

- A 12-week ahead forecast
- Trend and seasonality decomposition
- A benchmark for more complex models

(Plots and details are referenced from the baseline Prophet module.)

## 4. Sales Anomaly Detection

This component analyzes weekly sales for each store–department combination and flags
statistically unusual spikes and dips using rolling statistics and z-scores.

It is used to:
- Monitor demand behavior relative to recent history.
- Identify holiday and promotion-driven spikes.
- Detect potential stockouts or operational issues when sales drop unusually.

The anomaly detection module produces:
- A time series chart with anomalies highlighted.
- A table of anomalous weeks with z-scores and holiday indicators.

In a production environment, this logic would run across all series using distributed
compute and feed anomaly summaries into alerting systems and KPI dashboards.

## 5. Price Elasticity & Promotion Impact

This component estimates how demand responds to changes in price and promotion status
for a given store–department.

A simple log-linear model is used:

\[
\log(\text{sales}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{price}) + \beta_2 \cdot \text{promo} + \epsilon
\]

Where:
- β₁ represents **price elasticity** (typically negative).
- β₂ captures the **multiplicative uplift** from promotions.

Outputs:
- Elasticity estimate (e.g., –1.3 → 1% price increase leads to ~1.3% decrease in demand).
- Promo uplift (e.g., 30–40% higher demand during promo weeks).
- Demand curve plots relating price to weekly sales.

In the broader system, these elasticity and uplift estimates feed into:
- Price and promo scenario tools.
- Margin and revenue optimization analyses.
- Feature engineering for downstream forecasting models.
